# Unit testing with COBOL

This is a demonstration of what is possible in terms of unit testing with COBOL. For this we implement the [FizzBuzz kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/).

To implement and run the unit tests we make use of [@neopragma](https://github.com/neopragma)'s [cobol-unit-test](https://github.com/neopragma/cobol-unit-test).
